                "description": "Enjoy your authentic middle eastern vacation with the breath-taking Tel Avivian sunset. Sitting right above the always bustling tayelet and nuzzled between the Marina and Ben Gurion Boulevard, Marina Ben Gurion is a brand new Hostel in the refurbished young and lively Kikar Atarim.\n\n**The space**\ndorm room 10 houses 3 bunk beds, a toilet and shower, air conditioning, and wifi. The reservations in this room are relevant towards a single bed. Just like a dorm you will have the experience of sharing a room with new people.\nRight outside the hostel room you have access to a newly finished outdoor courtyard and kitchen. This shared urban yard is perfect for gathering in small groups, as well as taking time to use the shared outdoor kitchen, filled with new appliances. However, what truly makes Marina Ben Gurion Hostel one of a kind is the partnership with local NPO The Social Space. Proceeds from Marina Ben Gurion contribute to social action in issues like gender inequality. The Social Space is a platform for deepening the discourse and encouraging involvement in social action.\n\n**Guest access**\nHaving Gordon Beach as your front yard, beach proximity is what we are known for. Activities like surfing, sailing, paddleboarding, and the Gordon Pool are right at your fingertips. Effortless beach days are all yours. After the beach, you can spend your evenings at Dizengoff Center, Jaffa, or Neve Tzedek, as we are centrally located and surrounded by cafes, restaurants, bars, nightlife, and cultural attractions.",

I started hosting people over 10 years ago in a small guest house in Nazareth. I wanted to give people a home away from home, providing everything they needed under one roof. Great accommodation, great information and warm welcoming people that would help others explore and discover the world. 5 years later I was hosting people in Jerusalem too, helping them to discover the fascinating city and giving them a safe, engaging and comforting base to explore from. Now I am in the big, vibrant, exciting city of Tel Aviv. A home on the road, Abraham Hostel Tel Aviv is a melting pot of multiculturalism, bringing together an international community of travellers. Hosting guests from around the world who enjoy our warm atmosphere, convenient location, friendly staff, daily events and tours, and extensive facilities. Since living here I am able to roam the streets of Old Jaffa and it's eclectic flea market, discover the hidden street art of the edgy Florentine neighbourhood, taste the delights of the Carmel and Levinsky markets and chill everyday on the beach. I love nothing more to sit in a local coffee house watching the world pass by on Rothschild Boulevard, soaking in the city and it's people. This is what I want to share with my guests.",
